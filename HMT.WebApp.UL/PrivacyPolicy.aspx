            <h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
            <p>
                Protecting your privacy and the confidentiality of your personal information is very important to us. 
                This Privacy Policy explains why we collect personal information and how we collect, use, disclose, store and protect your personal information. 
                It also explains how you can access, correct, update or delete any personal information provided to us, or make a complaint if you have concerns. 
                We comply with the Australian Privacy Principles ("APPs") which regulate how we collect, use, disclose, store, correct and protect your personal information.
            </p>


            <h3>WHAT IS PERSONAL INFORMATION?</h3>
            <p>
                Personal information is any information about an identifiable individual and so includes any information that can be used to identify you, 
                such as your name, gender, date of birth, address, telephone number, email or medical, educational, financial, and employment information.
            </p>


            <h3>WHAT PERSONAL INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT?</h3>
            <p>
                We may collect personal information including your name, gender, date of birth, address, telephone number and email. 
                Information about your computer hardware and software is also automatically collected by us when you use our website. 
                This information can include your IP address, browser type, access times and/or referring website addresses. 
                This information is used by us for the operation of the website and the services offered on the website and to maintain the quality of the services offered on the website.
            </p>
            <p>
                We do not collect your financial information or retain credit card numbers used to purchase products or services as this information is collected 
                by a financial institution that has their own privacy policy. If you receive a request to provide sensitive personal information (such as credit card details) 
                in an email, do not provide this information because the request may be fraudulent. You can help us identify attempts at fraud - if anything suspicious occurs, 
                please contact our Privacy Officer.
            </p>


            <h3>WHY DO WE COLLECT YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?</h3>
            <p>
                We may collect your personal information when required by law but generally we collect personal information from you (or about you) to allow us to:
